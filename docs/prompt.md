This is a brand new next.js project

This project is intended as the front end for accessing fastapi backend /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s1-fastapi-workflow-post/README.md and /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s1-fastapi-workflow-post/CLAUDE.md

Study the following files carefully:

- /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s1-fastapi-workflow-post/docs/api_guide.md
- /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s1-fastapi-workflow-post/docs/endpoints.md
- /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s1-fastapi-workflow-post/docs/examples.md



Create a plan at docs\  as an .md document to create frontend that facilitate the intention as stated in backend documentation. We'll be focusing on BLog post generation, with considering that we will have video generation as well. Based on backend documents, determine what input are needed for generating  post (by post, it's not only a blog post, but the complete workflow from keyword research to social snippet generation). We're going to implement fetching the data from the database. But for starter, we could create a test page to make sure that the blogpost creating is working by directly shows what the backend provide without calling the data from database.

From backend of post creation, like stated at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s1-fastapi-workflow-post/core/workflow_engine.py, we will have the following process:

- keyword_research
- content_generation"
- seo_optimization
- image_prompt_generation
- image_generation
- thumbnail_creation
- social_snippet_generation

Each of them should have output to be displayed for user.

We need to create an awesome workflow interface that indicate the progress. Think of a creative and intuitive way to display the workflow, that the backend would "report" the progress so user can view it. So not only we show the result, but also the progress. For all of this, discuss your plan with gemini 2.5 pro using Gemini MCP until you have the "perfect" plan. The goal is to give user great experience, especially since this workflow would require some time to complete.

We got error upon request from front end:

Please create sub-agent, to act as frontend agent developer. Ask it to study the frontend thoroughly: 

- Begin with /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/README.md
- Continue with /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/docs/backend-integration.md
- /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/docs/quick-start-backend.md
- /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/docs/troubleshooting.md

To give you context, here's what I asked the front end developer to do :

```

Use sequential thinking MCP to help you think.

The frontend agent should focus on how to create intuitive interface. How to logic and rule should determined by backend developer, that is you. The first focus is to make the function to work. Currently, the error triggered from executing "Start Demo Workflow" at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/src/app/generate/page.tsx (I havent tried other scenario)

After implementing the first priority, create report, do npm run check and npm run build. Fix any errors. If done, do git commit with github MCP. Provide useful comment.

The second priority is to make the intention of front end to be fulfilled. Since I asked the front end to display the workflow intuitively, this might require backend to emit progress report on each task completion. Both of you, discuss about it. Ask Gemini MCP for opinion how the best approach to fulfill the frontend intention and create plan and begin implementation. Create a .md to track your progress.

On "Start Demo Workflow" on frontend:
- /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/README.md

I'm getting "Loading workflow..." text and there's nothing going on. it stopped. No error message on user's browser.

You can assign sub agent to deal with front end.

The newly created files on frontend are /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/src/components/workflow/WorkflowTracker.tsx and /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/src/components/workflow/ControlTower.tsx

"Start demo workflow" is at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/FABRIC/s2-content-creator/src/components/workflow/ControlTower.tsx

You can use gemini MCP to help dealing with front end, and ask suggestion.
